# Lead-Scoring-with-Logistic-Regression
X Education, an online course provider, faces challenges in converting leads into paying customers. 
The company acquires leads through web traffic, form submissions, and referrals. 
However, the lead conversion rate is currently low, at around 30%. 
To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, often referred to as 'Hot Leads.' By focusing efforts on these high-potential leads, the company expects to increase the lead conversion rate to around 80%.
This project involves building a lead scoring model using logistic regression. Each lead will be assigned a lead score to indicate their likelihood of conversion. 
Leads with higher scores are more likely to become paying customers, while those with lower scores are less likely. The model aims to maximize the chances of conversion by prioritizing communication with the most promising leads.
