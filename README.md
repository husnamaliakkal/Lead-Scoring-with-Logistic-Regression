# Lead Scoring with Logistic Regression

X Education, an online course provider, faces challenges in converting leads into paying customers. The company acquires leads through web traffic, form submissions, and referrals. However, the lead conversion rate is currently low, at around 30%. To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, often referred to as 'Hot Leads.'

## Project Overview
The project involves building a lead scoring model using logistic regression. Each lead will be assigned a lead score to indicate their likelihood of conversion. Leads with higher scores are more likely to become paying customers, while those with lower scores are less likely. The model aims to maximize the chances of conversion by prioritizing communication with the most promising leads.

## Key Tasks
- Build a lead scoring model using logistic regression.
- Assign lead scores to indicate the likelihood of conversion.
- Prioritize communication with high-potential leads to increase the lead conversion rate.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about leads, including their source, activity on the website, and interaction with the company's content.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve the model's performance.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model to predict lead scores.
- **Lead Scoring**: Assign lead scores based on the model predictions.

## Conclusion
By prioritizing communication with high-potential leads identified by the lead scoring model, X Education aims to increase the lead conversion rate from 30% to around 80%. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of logistic regression in lead scoring and conversion rate optimization.
